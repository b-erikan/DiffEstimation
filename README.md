# DiffEstimation
C++ copy of the AlgebraicDifferentiator class from Dr. Oathmane. 

The intention is to get a fast and working code for a specific implementation. Therefore, some parameter check functions and options are omitted by hard-coding the parameters. 
If the result is satisfactory with the controller, this library can be improved for future projects.
